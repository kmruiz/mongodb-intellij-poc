inspection.QueryIndexingQualityInspection=Query is not properly indexed.
inspection.QueryIndexingQualityInspection.basicQueryNotCovered=    \
Query is not covered by a proper index in namespace "{0}.{1}".  \n \
                                                                 \n \
Available Indexes:                                               \n \
{2}

inspection.QueryIndexingQualityInspection.queryMightUseTheAttributePattern=\
Query is not covered by a proper index in namespace "{0}.{1}".  \n \
Query is using dynamic field names and cardinality is relatively high (4+ fields).\n\
You might want to use the attribute pattern for your query:      \n \

inspection.QueryIndexingQualityInspection.queryCoveredByMultipleIndexes=    \
Query is covered by multiple indexes in namespace "{0}.{1}".  \n \
Best practices recommend that a query should be covered only by one index. \n \
However, this query can be covered by the following indexes: \n \
{2}

inspection.QueryIndexingQualityInspection.indexIsNotShardKey=    \
Query is covered by an index, but is not the sharding key of namespace "{0}.{1}".  \n \
Best practices recommend adding the sharding key to all queries in a sharded collection. \n \
This query will be a scatter gather query, running in parallel in all shards. \n \
\n \
Index covering the query: {2}\n \
Sharding key: {3}
